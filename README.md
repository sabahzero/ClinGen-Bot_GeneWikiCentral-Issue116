## About
This automated bot retrieves gene-disease validity data from [ClinGen](https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-validity) and integrates it into Wikidata as 'genetic association' statements for both gene and disease item pages on a weekly basis. </br></br>
Example gene A2ML1: </br>
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18051234
![Genetic Association for A2ML1](https://github.com/sabahzero/ClinGen-Bot_GeneWikiCentral-Issue116/blob/master/README-images/Genetic-Association.png)
In this example, we see the last commit by the bot was on October 1, 2019 for this gene-disease association under the gene (A2ML1) item page.
